<p><font face="Helvetica" size="3"><b>Retail - risk management</b><br>
  Every loan application will be evaluated on various predefined risk parameters 
  that vary depending on the loan type. The major categories are:<br>
  -Personal details<br>
  -Employment details<br>
  -Financial details<br>
  -Property details<br>
  -Other rules</font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica" size="3">Each category will evaluate the applicant on 
  various parameters. Each such criterion will carry a score. The aggregate of 
  these scores will be considered as the overall Rating for the applicant. Based 
  on this score, LAPS will offer recommendation on &#147;approval&#148; or &#147;rejection&#148; 
  of the loan. For instance a score between &#147;59 - 82&#148; could be rated 
  as excellent while applying for a housing loan. You can define a Cutoff score 
  for each retail loan product in the &#147;Global options module. While the score 
  ranges and the description for each range is defined in the &#147;Cutoff score&#148; 
  module. Score ranges, description and cutoff score is soft and hence you can 
  define it yourself.</font></p>
