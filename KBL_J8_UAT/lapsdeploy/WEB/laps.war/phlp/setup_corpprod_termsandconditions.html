  Necessary terms and conditions can be added for each facility under &quot;Terms 
  &amp; conditions&quot; in the SETUP module. The relevant list is displayed while 
  a loan is processed. Along with this new terms can also be appended during the 
  loan processing cycle depending on the applicant. For instance, the corporate 
  applicant could be a new customer but possesses an excellent reputation or comes 
  with an excellent recommendation from a very reputed customer. In such situations 
  the Banker might want to give the loan but to reduce risk he may add an additional 
  'condition' of early repayment etc. The user when required can also delete any 
  such term added. A list of such deleted terms & conditions can be seen at any 
  point in time by clicking &quot;Deleted terms&quot; along with the reason for 
  such an action </font> </font></p>
