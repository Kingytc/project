<p><font face="Helvetica" size="3">The QIS Master is where various customized 
  QIS formats can be created for each CMA. The creation of parameters that form 
  the statement is similar to creating financials/ cash flow/ funds flow etc. 
  The entire set of &#147;Group names and row descriptions and formulas&#148; 
  that were created for the financial part of the corporate loan application are 
  made available for creating QIS. Additional formulas can be created using the 
  &#147;Formula definition&#148; screen if required for the QIS.<br>
