Audit trail is the ultimate security aspect in LAPS. This feature enables the 
administrator to view modifications / deletions carried out by every LAPS user 
on loan applications. In other words fixing responsibility of action for an action 
becomes possible and mishandling is reduced to a considerable extent. </font>
