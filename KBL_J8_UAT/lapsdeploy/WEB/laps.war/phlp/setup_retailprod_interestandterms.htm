  Interest rate will be defined depending on the loan amount and term of loan.

  months of repayment can have a different interest rate from a loan amount that 
  falls within the same loan amount range but has a repayment term of up to 48 
  months.</font></p>

  <p><b>Step-up interest rate</b><br>
    Multiple Interest rates can be defined for a loan product for a loan disbursed. 
    For instance, <br>
  <ul><li>For a loan amount of Rs 1,50,000: </li><br>
   <li>Interest rate for the first 50,000 rupees might be 12 % - EMI (1) for 50,000 
    @12% </li><br>
    <li>Till Rs 1,00,000 the interest rate charged could be 11% - EMI (2) for 50,000 
    but @ a rate of 11%. </li><br>
    <li>The rest of the loan amount, i.e., 50,000 the interest rate could be 9% - 
    EMI (3) for this 50,000 @ a rate of 9%. </li><br>
    <li>Thus &#147;Actual EMI&#148; = EMI (1) + EMI (2) + EMI (3)</li><br>
    <li>EMI - Principal * Interest * Term</li></ul>
