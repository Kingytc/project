  <p><font face="Helvetica" size="3"><b>New Products</b><br>
    Select the radio button adjacent to this option to trigger the creation of 
    a new loan product, you will see the new loan creation screens. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica" size="3"><b>Existing Products</b><br>
    A fully configured loan product is deemed as &#148;completed&#148; which means 
    loan applications can be received and processed for that loan product. Such 
    &#147;partial&#148;/ &#147;completed&#148; loan products can be viewed by 
    selecting the radio button &#147;existing products&#148;. Various search criteria 
    based on the product completion status (partial, complete) are also available.<br>
    Loan products that are already in use in loan applications may have to be 
    appended/ modified due to market conditions. To face such situations, any 
    completed loan product (even if in use by many loan applications) can be pulled 
    out from under the &#147;existing products&#148; option and then renewed. 
    Which means a renewed application hence can be modified/ appended and used 
    for new loan applications. Renewal can be carried out multiple times.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica" size="3"><b>Old Products</b><br>
    By selecting this radio button, one can view all loan products that have been 
    renewed.</font></p>
