<p><font face="Helvetica" size="3">The ratios can be for &#147;Historical&#148; 
  or &#147;Projected&#148; years. Historical is the last five years leaving out 
  the current year. While projections is for the next 5 years excluding the current 
  year. If &#147;Historical&#148; is chosen, the average of the last five years 
  is taken and compared with that of last year. And in the same way if &#147;Projections&#148; 
  is chosen then the average of the next 5 years is compared with the next years 
  ratio<br>
  The value so arrived at is compared to the range given in this screen and the 
  corresponding &#147;point&#148; is taken into the Rating model as the score</font></p>
