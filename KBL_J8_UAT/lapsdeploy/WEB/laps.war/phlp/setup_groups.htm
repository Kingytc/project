  Collection of users forms a Group. Navigation within LAPS module depends on 
  the group&#146;s access rights. Each group has different navigational and data 
  security rights, which can be defined in this module. </font> </p>
<p><br>
  <ul>
  Whenever a user is added to the system, he/she will be assigned to one of the 
  predefined groups. When a user's authority changes, an authorized person should 
  reassign that user to a different group. <br>
  Group name: Before defining or modifying rights for a specific group, name should 
  be entered for a group and it is mandatory.<p></p>
<p>Access Rights</p>
<p>Navigational security: <br>
  One or more of the below mentioned navigational rights can be given for a group 
  by selecting the appropriate check box.<br>
  Application Allows access to view the application, which is further restricted 
  by data security rights. <br>
  Setup-users Allows access to add / modify new users and also delete existing 
  users. <br>
  Loan service Allows access to view loan services, which is further restricted 
  by data security rights. <br>
  Setup-groups Allows access to view, add, modify and delete groups. <br>
  Setup-others Allows access into all modules of setup, other than groups, users 
  and products. <br>
  Auditor&#146;s report This option gets enabled only when 'application' option 
  is enabled. This allows access to view auditor&#146;s report, which is further 
  restricted by data security rights. <br>
  Administration User with admin rights alone can have access to global options 
  and undelete applications modules. <br>
  Setup-products Allows access to add, modify and delete loan product(s). </p>
<p>Data security rights:<br>
  You can restrict the navigational rights given for a group by specifying any 
  one of the following data security rights:<br>
  Read: Specifying 'Read' option enables the users in the group to access and 
  view applications. But they cannot add or modify applications. <br>
  Write: Specifying 'Write' option enables the users in the group to access, add, 
  modify and delete applications.<br>
  None: If the option is 'none', then the users in the group cannot read or write 
  applications. </p>
<p>Current Organizational Level: <br>
  If you specify &#145;Read&#146; option under &#145;Current Organizational Level&#146;, 
  then it allows the users under the group to access and view applications in 
  the current organization level. If &#145;Write&#146; option is specified, then 
  the users in the group can read, add, modify or delete applications in the current 
  organization level.</p>
<p>Current Organization's Children:<br>
  This option is used to control access rights to applications in lower hierarchy 
  of the group's entity Level. For example, if the group is defined in third level 
  of the organization, this option controls the group&#146;s access to applications 
  belonging to fourth and fifth levels. </p>
<p>If you specify &#145;Read&#146; option under &#145;Current Organization&#146;s 
  Children&#146;, then it allows the users under the group to access and view 
  applications in the current organization&#146;s children. <br>
  If &#145;Write&#146; option is specified, then the users in the group can read, 
  add, modify or delete applications defined in the lower hierarchy. <br>
  If &#145;None&#146; option is specified, then the group does not have access 
  to applications in the lower hierarchy.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Other Organizations:<br>
  This part is used to control access to applications in rest of the organizations 
  other than the group&#146;s current organization and its lower hierarchies.<br>
