  You can create multiple processing fee ranges based on the loan amount. In other 
  words, for every loam amount range, you can define a new set of processing and 
  documentation fee. With LAPS, you can define processing/ documentation charges 
  by way of a range, percentage or a flat fee. </font> </p>

  <font face="Helvetica" size="3">By default the system control rests in &#147;processing&#148; 
  sub-tab. Click on the &#147;documentation&#148; sub-tab once you are through 
  with the processing sub-tab<br>
  Click &#147;Edit&#148;<br>

  Processing fees (%) - You can define the processing/ documentation fee in %.<br>

  fee that may be collected for processing charges from the customer. This can 
  also be a flat fee in which case a maximum amount need not be entered<br>
  Max processing/ documentation fee - Enter the upper limit for the processing 
  fee<br>
  Charges can be defined in terms of % or as a range. These charges vary according 
  to the loan product and the loan product is defined based on the amount range 
  they fall into. e.g. For Document fees present slabs are Up to 25000 - Nil, 
  &gt;25000 to 2lacs - Rs150/- etc. <br>
  If the documentation / processing fee is lower than the minimum fee mentioned 
  then this amount is taken as the charge if the documentation / processing fee 
  is higher than the maximum charge mentioned for that particular loan product 
  then the &#147;maximum processing/ documentation fee&#148; is taken as the charge<br>
  -Documentation/ Processing Charges are specified in %age terms the Min / Max 
  need not be mandatory. The field &#147;Select processing amount range&#148; 
  displays the amount range selected for various products.<br>
