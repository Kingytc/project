<p> Home -&gt; Risk Management - Risk Rating -&gt; Personal Details</p>
<p><b><font face="Helvetica" size="3">Personal Details</font></b><font face="Helvetica" size="3"><br>
  A screen appears with the sub-tabs namely, Age, educational qualification, marital 
  status, mobility of individual, No. of. Dependents. Each of the sub-tab carries 
  scores that will vary according to the loan product. The aggregate of all these 
  scores will be taken as the final score on the applicant &#146;personal details&#148; 
  </font></p>
<p> <font face="Helvetica" size="3"><b>Age</b><br>
  By default the control will be in this sub-tab<br>
  Business rule ID - Click the dropdown box<br>
  Select the loan product<br>
  Enter various age ranges and the points in the boxes provided. The age range 
  and points should be picked up from the official directive (rating model) approved 
  by the board. <br>
  Lets take an example, if an applicant has asked for a housing loan then based 
  on his age, he could be earning the following points:<br>
  Range from Range To Points Description <br>
  21 35 4 <br>
  36 50 3 <br>
  51 100 0 <br>
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica" size="3">Description can be entered if required<br>
  In our example, if the applicant&#146;s age is 27, then he/ she falls between 
  the range &#147;21-35&#148; and hence will earn &#147;4&#148; points. <br>
  Click &#147;Save&#148; to save changes<br>
  Click &#147; cancel&#148; to cancel the operation. Data entered so far will 
  not be saved in this case.<br>
