<p><font face="Helvetica" size="3"><b>Lending Powers</b><br>
  The discretionary lending powers for C &amp; I advances are defined here in 
  this setup screen. You can enter different sanction limits according to the 
  Scale of the official. Lending powers in global setup is where you can define 
  the maximum annual loan amount that can be disbursed by a hierarchical group 
  in the bank. For example, the maximum amount &#147;General Managers&#148; belonging 
  can disburse. A clear split up of this amount to be given to any corporate Group 
  (e.g., Tata Sons, K K Birla Group, Reliance Group of industries, D G Piramal 
  Group etc). &#147;Per party&#148; limit for each individual company within the 
  Groups can be defined as well. &#147;Per party&#148; loan limit again is divided 
  between; Fund based and Non- fund based.</font> </p>
<p>Other checkpoints in the &#147;Lending powers&#148; screen:<br>
  Unsecured Advances out of Per Party Limit, not to exceed <br>
  Guarantee / LC with 100% cash margin or guarantee of other banks / FIs @, and 
  advance against Bank&#146;s own deposit<br>
  Ad Hoc / Excess over sanctioned Limit <br>
  Maximum Limit <br>
  For no. of months <br>
  % of sanctioned Fund</p>
<p>When a approving authority (for example, Assistant General Manager) clicks 
  the &#147;Approve/ sanction&#148; button for a corporate loan, LAPS checks the 
  following:<br>
  The annual loam sanction limit of the official, In our example, AGM should have 
  enough limit left for him to cover the current loan requested. The annual cap 
  includes retail loans as well<br>
  <p>The fund-based loan requested by any party should not exceed the &#147;fund 
  based per party limit&#148; of the official (our example, AGM). The limit includes 
  retail loans as well. In the same way the non-fund based loan amount requested 
  cannot exceed the non-fund based limit for the official. Finally, the total 
  of &#147;fund based per party&#148; limit and the &#147;non fund based per party&#148; 
  that the applicant has asked for should not exceed the &#147;Aggregate&#148; 
  limit of the official&#146;s &#147;authority&#148; level defined in this &#147;lending 
  powers&#148; screen. For the ED and Chairman there is no split as fund-based 
  and non-fund based.</p>
  <p>Fund based per party loan requested + Non fund based per party loan requested 
  &lt; = Aggregate per party limit of the official<br>
  The aggregate of the loan amounts secured by all companies in the group and 
  the loan requested now by the applicant cannot exceed the &#147;Group limit&#148; 
  of the official. In our example, the AGM&#146;s group limit is Rs 90000000.00. 
  So if the other companies in a group has taken a aggregate loan amount of Rs 
  X then 90000000.00 &lt;= X + current loan amount requested by the applicant</p>
  <p>X could contain loan taken earlier by the same applicant also along with loans 
  taken by other companies in the group<br>
  The Unsecured advances taken by the applicant should not exceed the amount that 
  is within the sanction limits of the approving authority. That is mentioned 
  in this screen in the field &#147;Unsecured advances out of per party limit, 
  not to exceed&#148;<br>
  For export based units, officials below the cadre of General Manager have a 
  limit of 125% of their &#147;fund-based limit&#148;. For officials who are General 
  Managers and above have a 150% of the fund-based limit</p>
