  maximum compulsory parameters and maximum compulsory relevant parameters <br>
  Compulsory &amp; relevant parameters - It is mandatory to create the exact number 
  of parameters as defined in the above mentioned field. For instance, if the 
  maximum compulsory parameters = 5 and maximum relevant parameters = 4 then 5

  Parameters and 4 relevant parameters have to be defined. At the borrower level 
  the number of parameters should be same as the number defined here both of them 
  are mandatory. The system maintains a control of the exact number and gives 
  an alert when the &#147;Rating analysis&#148; is carried out. <br>

  in the Rating model is defined here. This score would be a composite weightage
