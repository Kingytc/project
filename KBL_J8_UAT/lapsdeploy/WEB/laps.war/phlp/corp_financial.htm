<p><font face="Helvetica" size="3"> The financial module of LAPS will be the most 
  dynamic part of the software. The corporate office will define the balance sheet 
  format based on the industry. The corporate office has also defined various 
  formulas and ratios. All you have to do is enter the applicant&#146;s financial 
  data in the given format.</font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica" size="3">As mentioned above, a different financials 
  format will be available for each industry (e.g. Software industry, Heavy engineering, 
  leather industry etc). Consecutively the way the financial data is collected 
  may differ according to the industry. This flexibility lies with the corporate 
  office.</font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica" size="3">The &#147;financials&#148; tab will have multiple 
  sub-tabs (e.g. Cost of sales, Income statement, Current assets, Current liabilities, 
  Networth etc). The title/ nature of which may differ according to the industry. 
  Saving data, canceling and closing the screen is similar to other tabs present 
  in the corporate application form</font>. </p>
