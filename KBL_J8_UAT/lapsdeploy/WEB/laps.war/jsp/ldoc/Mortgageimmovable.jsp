        Under Transfer of Property Act, a mortgage of a specific immovable property 
        can be created for the purpose of securing the payment of money advanced 
        or to be advanced, or existing or future debt, the performance of an engagement 
        which may give rise to a pecuniary liability. Accordingly, equitable mortgage 
        can be for existing advances or for future advances and also for Non Fund 
        Based facilities, (which give raise to a pecuniary liability in future). 
        There are six types of mortgages recognised under the Transfer of Property 
        Act viz.</p>

        In a simple mortgage, without delivering possession of the mortgaged property, 
        the mortgagor binds himself by a mortgage deed to personally pay back 
        to the mortgagee and agrees that in the event of his failing to pay back 
        the money according to his contract, the mortgagee shall have a right 
        to cause the mortgaged property to be sold and the sale proceeds applied 
        in repayment of of the money. Simple mortgage is always in writing and 
        it attracts stamp duty as per the State Law. The stamped mortgage deed 
        duly executed by the mortgagor in favour of the Bank and attested by 2 
        witnesses is to be registered with the Registrar of Assurances. In the 
        revised set of documents, following documents have been introduced for 
        simple mortgage. They are: </p> </font></td>

        how to create an equitable mortgage is available in Instruction Circular 
        No. 3072 which is reproduced herewith. The formats of Memorandum OF Deposit 
        of Title Deeds have been added to the List of Auxiliary Documents to enable 
        the Branches to have printed Memorandum copy readily at their end. However 
        in those case there are many properties and the details cannot be written 
        there in the format, the same may be typed out and typed copy may be used. 
        Similarly, the Declaration to be obtained from the Borrower-Mortgagor 
        stipulated by I.C. 3072 and those by Mortgagor-Guarantor provided by the 
        subsequent circular of Central Law Dept no. CLD: BBT dated 21-12-1995 
        and the Draft of Memorandum of Entry prescribed by Instruction Circular 
        3570 dated 02-11-1987 are included in the &#147;Other Documents&#148; 
        list of Chapter II. These declarations are to be obtained in non-judicial 
        stamp paper. </p> </font>

        The Instruction Circular no. 3072 among other things stipulated that a 
        Certificate from Income Tax authorities under Section 281(1)(ii) of Income 
        Tax Act has to be obtained and produced by the Mortgagor to the Bank while 
        creating equitable mortgage. Obtaining such certificate has been found 
        to be difficult and branches have requested for waiver of this stipulation 
        in I.C. 3072. The new Circular No. 6118 dated 15-11-2000 has granted certain 
        relaxation. The format for an affidavit in lieu of the I.T.C. has also 
        been incorporated in the &#147;other Documents&#148; in Part VIII of Chapter

        All the circulars stated above are reproduced herewith for ready reference 
        of the branches. Two other circulars reproduced are (1) Instruction Circular 
        No. 5572 dated 04-11-1997 which has banned creation of mortgage by certified 
        copy of title deeds and (2) Instruction Circular No. CLD:PSP:276 dated 
        07-02-1997 which has advised that the charges of equitable mortgagee may 
        be noted with the Revenue authorities. Both these circulars stand modified/relaxed 
        by the latest Instruction Circular no. 6118 dated 15-11-2000. </p> </font> <br>
