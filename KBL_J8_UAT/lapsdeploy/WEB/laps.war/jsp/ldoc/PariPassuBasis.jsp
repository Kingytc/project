      <p align="justify">The original documents of the property would be lying with the First 
        Lender which has granted the first home loan and an equitable mortgage 
        must be in existence favouring the said First Lender and hence when we 
        agree for granting the additional loan it must be explained to the proposed 
        borrower that the First Lender should cede pari passu first charge in 
        favour of our Bank (UBI) for the additional home loan sanctioned and the 
        proposed borrower should obtain and produce formal permission from the 
        First Lender.</p>
      <p align="justify">Our proposed borrower may be given the draft documents as per Annexures 
        A-1 to A-3. The proposed borrower should address a letter to the First 
        Lender as per Annexure A-1 enclosing copies of draft documents as per 
        Annexure A-2 &amp; A-3 under copy to UBI. If UBI receives a clear approval 
        for ceding pari passu charge and to execute necessary documents as per 
        our drafts, then the proposed borrower may be advised to visit the First 
        Lender and offer oral consent for creation of pari passu charge in favour 
        of UBI. UBI representative has to accompany the Borrower to the First 
        Lender to witness the recording of oral consent of the Borrower for creation 
        of pari passu charge. UBI representative to carry the Letter of Authority 
        as per Annexure A-2. He should collect one copy of the Memorandum of Entry 
        from the First Lender. The letter of the Borrower as stated above and 
        Memorandum of entry are to be preserved along with other security documents 
        on the subject loan. In the case of Joint loans if the property being 
        charged/mortgaged belongs to more than one borrower, one should be authorised 
        by others to create pari passu charge as stated above.</p>
