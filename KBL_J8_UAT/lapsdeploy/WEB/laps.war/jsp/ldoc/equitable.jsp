        procedure to be followed for creation of equitable mortgage. Some branches 
        have represented that hardship is caused to small borrowers who are asked 
        to produce prior permission of Income Tax Officer, search report for 30 
        years, etc. With a view to reduce hardship to such borrowers, we clarify

        upto Rs.50,000/-, title deeds may be accepted by one Officer only. It 
        is further clarified that title deeds are to be deposited at the lending 
        branch (or at the nearest branch in notified town if the lending branch 
        is not situated in a notified area) and it is for the lending branch to 
        ensure that title is clear, unencumbered and marketable.</p> </font>

        In certain States, stamp duty is imposed by State Governments. In such 
        cases, a local advocate may be consulted. (As far as Maharashtra State 
        is concerned, stamp duty of 2% of the advances to be secured is imposed 
        from 10.12.1985 on any Agreement, memorandum or other writing relating 
        to deposit of title deeds. Hence, in Maharashtra State, the memorandum 
        as per Annexure &#145;E&#146; and &#145;F&#146; of I.C. 3072 with necessary 
        changes* may be typed on a stamp paper of appropriate value. If additional 
        advances are given after 10.12.1985 in Maharashtra State, stamp duty is 
        to be given on the additional advance amount to be secured. In that case, 
        the draft as per Annexure enclosed may be used with required changes. 
        Please note that the equitable mortgage is created the moment title deeds 
        are deposited in a notified area with an intent to create a security therein. 
        Even without memorandum, equitable mortgage can be proved with oral evidence 
        of branch officials who were present at the time of deposit. If the memorandum 
        is not stamped as required by State Law, if any, the memorandum will not 
        be acceptable as evidence in Court. Memorandum as per I.C. 3072 and acceptable 
        in evidence must be prepared and kept on record. *(see page 4 note 4)</p> </font>
